 * Every buildable source file, in a STABLE order.
 *
 * The browser build below takes an entry per file, and the obvious spelling,
 * `entry: ["src/**\/*.ts", ...]`, leaves that list in glob order, which is not
 * stable across runs. Measured: two consecutive builds of identical sources
 * disagreed on 67 chunk NAMES and 335 files by content, because entry order
 * feeds esbuild's chunk composition and its content hashes. `dist` is committed,
 * so that turned every release into an arbitrary ~1,100-file diff.
 *
 * Sorting removes that churn, so a release diff carries close to only the files
 * that actually changed. It does NOT make the build byte-reproducible: esbuild's
 * own emission still varies in 0 to 23 files of 1,110 between runs, and a chunk
 * name follows its content hash, so an occasional name moves too (seen once on a
 * CI runner). `test/build-shape.spec.ts` therefore asserts THIS ORDERING, which
 * is ours to control, instead of diffing two builds, which is not.

 * `dist`, which the auto-changeset bot owns and which is legitimately stale on
 * any branch that edits this file.
 *
 * It has to be a root rather than a per-build override: `tsup --out-dir` would
 * apply to BOTH configs in this array, pointing them at one directory, and the
 * browser config below sets `clean: true`. Keeping a subdirectory each is what
 * the normal build already does, so the guard exercises the real layout.

        //
        // With an entry per file plus `splitting`, esbuild hoists shared code into
        // chunks and `index.js` becomes a set of re-exports. `sideEffects: false`
        // is already declared, so a downstream bundler can then drop what a route

        // is retained whole as soon as one export in it is used.
        //
        // The cost is file count: dist/browser goes from 4 JS files to ~1100, and

        // only the files they import.

        // `splitting` also unifies module state across entry points. Today
        // `dist/node/index.*` and `dist/node/hive.*` are separate bundles, so each
        // carries its OWN copy of hive-tx's mutable config (nodes, User-Agent,
        // resilience, server RPC proxy). `apps/web` relies on that isolation:
        // `app/api/internal/seo/sitemap-generate/route.ts` calls `setNodes` and
        // `setUserAgent` through `@ecency/sdk/hive` to point ONE route at the
        // curated public-node list, while the rest of SSR keeps what
        // `core/sdk-init.ts` set through `ConfigManager`. Split the node build and
        // that route's settings become process-global for every concurrent render
        // in the same replica.
        //
        // The browser build shares one copy after this change, which is the right
        // behaviour for a single-user process. Verified inert for current
        // consumers: `apps/web` never imports `@ecency/sdk/hive` on the client,
        // and `apps/self-hosted`, which imports both entries, never configures
        // hive-tx in the browser.
