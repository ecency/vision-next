### Patch Changes

- [#1829](https://github.com/ecency/vision-web/pull/1829) [`68cbbd1`](https://github.com/ecency/vision-web/commit/68cbbd1a924eba9d556baf9d6dc87929c06af8bf) Thanks [@feruzm](https://github.com/feruzm)! - Judge a legacy sized-proxy URL's `<picture>` eligibility by the file it wraps.

  `isPictureEligibleRawUrl` waved `images.hive.blog/<WxH>/…` and
  `steemitimages.com/<WxH>/…` through unconditionally, on the grounds that a
  pinned format could not change what the reader sees: the origin returned the
  ORIGINAL bytes for `?format=avif` on an animated source. ecency/imagehoster#47
  ended that. Animated sources are re-rendered now. Since libvips cannot write an
  animated AVIF, `?format=avif` resolves to WebP, or to the untouched source when
  the render is over the host's output budget. Either way
  `<source type="image/avif">` described bytes that were not AVIF. The browser
  committed to that source without ever reaching the `<img>` fallback.

  These URLs never actually hid their extension: the nested source sits in the
  path, where the same extractor the `/p/` hash is built from returns it. They are
  now judged by that nested file under the existing rules. Measured over 804 live
  posts, 94.6% of them wrap a static raster and keep their `<picture>`.

## 2.5.36

### Patch Changes

- Ask for the requested size when a cover image is a gif (#1830)

- [#1830](https://github.com/ecency/vision-web/pull/1830) [`1812ed8`](https://github.com/ecency/vision-web/commit/1812ed84804d6990f682b8b8889faf46d9100126) Thanks [@feruzm](https://github.com/feruzm)! - Ask for the requested size when a post's cover image is a gif.

  Every proxify in `getImage` fell back to the ORIGINAL dimensions for a `.gif`
  source, so a caller asking for a 600x500 thumbnail was handed the whole file.
  On the post behind ecency/vision-next#1802 that is 1.5 MB arriving in a 150px
  feed slot, which was the single largest LCP cost on `/trending`. It reached
  every sized caller, open graph images at 1200x630 included.

  The reason was that the image host returned animated sources untransformed at
  any size, so a sized URL only minted a second cache key holding the same bytes.
  ecency/imagehoster#47 re-renders them at the requested box, keeping every frame
  or passing through untouched, so the size is now worth asking for: that same
  source at 600x500 is 195,318 bytes of animated WebP against 1,572,008 of GIF,
  40 frames and the same 5000ms running time.

## 2.5.35

### Patch Changes

- [#1803](https://github.com/ecency/vision-web/pull/1803) [`876c3b8`](https://github.com/ecency/vision-web/commit/876c3b89beb2b5df955eadc944cfb81d6ebda20b) Thanks [@feruzm](https://github.com/feruzm)! - Add `getEntryCardImageRawUrl`, the raw (pre-proxify) URL of the image a CARD
  renders.

  `getEntryImageRawUrl` answers a body/LCP-preload question and deliberately skips
  `json_metadata.thumbnails`, while `catchPostImage` reads thumbnails first. A
  caller that needs to reason about the file a card will actually request — its
  extension, for instance — was therefore able to inspect one asset while the card
  rendered another. The new export mirrors catchPostImage's precedence:
  thumbnails, then image, then the first body image.

- Ask for a feed GIF once, not three times (#1803)

## 2.5.34

### Patch Changes

- Stop a crafted post body from throwing out of the image extractor (#1790)

- [#1790](https://github.com/ecency/vision-web/pull/1790) [`56e2a36`](https://github.com/ecency/vision-web/commit/56e2a36561fefae87931a91116e581ed2cffbf9f) Thanks [@feruzm](https://github.com/feruzm)! - Harden the sanitizer's numeric character reference decoding.

  `sanitizeHtml` decoded every attribute value with a private decoder that called
  `String.fromCodePoint` on the raw reference, so any value above U+10FFFF threw
  `RangeError: Invalid code point`. It now reuses the hardened `decodeEntities`
  from `helper.ts`, which maps out-of-range and overlong references to U+FFFD (as
  the HTML spec asks) and never throws. Ordinary decimal, hex and zero-padded
  references decode exactly as before.

  One deliberate behaviour change: the shared decoder also resolves NAMED
  references, which the private one did not. The decoded value is only ever
  compared against, never written back, so this only affects which values pass
  validation: `javascript&colon;` is still blanked (the scheme checks now see
  through the obfuscation), and `<img src="https:&sol;&sol;host/a.png">` is no
  longer blanked, because it decodes to the https URL a browser would resolve it
  to anyway and is proxied like any other external image.

  The throw escaped through both public entry points on chain-authored input:
  `catchPostImage` (called per feed card, per search row and for the feed
  thumbnail preload) on `<div title="&#x110000;">`, and `renderPostBody` on
  `<div title="&#1114112;">x</span>`, where the sanitizer is the last-resort pass
  that is supposed to recover from malformed HTML.

### Patch Changes

- Block ReDoS regexes via eslint-plugin-regexp in render-helper (#784)

- [#784](https://github.com/ecency/vision-next/pull/784) [`6e281b4`](https://github.com/ecency/vision-next/commit/6e281b453d51ab4f8dfb67be1bb57b383bb54279) Thanks [@feruzm](https://github.com/feruzm)! - Add `eslint-plugin-regexp` to the render-helper lint pipeline with
  `regexp/no-super-linear-backtracking` and `regexp/no-super-linear-move`
  set to `error`. The package processes untrusted user-authored markdown
  on the SSR hot path; a single super-linear regex is enough to pin Node
  for tens of seconds (see #782). Adding these rules to the package's
  own ESLint config means the next ReDoS-shaped pattern fails CI at PR
  time instead of in production.

  This PR also clears every super-linear regex finding the new rules
  surfaced in real source code, in addition to introducing the rules:
  - Three new linear-time helpers in `helper.ts` (`stripHtmlTags`,
    `trimTrailingSlash`, `stripQueryString`) replace six bounded-input
    regex sites that previously tripped `no-super-linear-move`.
  - The two URL regexes in `consts/regexes.const.ts` (`POST_REGEX`,
    `INTERNAL_POST_TAG_REGEX`) are anchored and use `[^/]+` for fixed
    path segments, eliminating the exchange-style backtracking while
    preserving the previous matching semantics — including the
    single-segment-middle constraint that the WHITE_LIST check in
    `a.method.ts` used to enforce indirectly.
  - The `endPattern` cleanup in `methods/markdown-to-html.method.ts` was
    replaced with a non-regex helper
    (`moveBlockClosingTagOutOfParagraph`) that anchors on `</p>` via
    `indexOf` and walks back over whitespace and an optional `<br>`.
    Same behaviour as the regex; linear time on whitespace-heavy inputs.

  After this PR there are no `regexp/*` disables remaining in
  `packages/render-helper/src/`.

## 2.5.0

### Minor Changes

- [#783](https://github.com/ecency/vision-next/pull/783) [`d443245`](https://github.com/ecency/vision-next/commit/d443245b4c98940c5a2510e792a74346f7f3eaf8) Thanks [@feruzm](https://github.com/feruzm)! - Add a slow-render warning to `markdown2Html`. When a single render takes
  500 ms or longer on the server, the function logs a
  `[render-helper] slow markdown render: …ms author=@… permlink=… body_len=…`
  line to `console.warn`. This surfaces both pathological inputs (e.g.
  ReDoS-prone tag attributes) and merely-slow ones (huge bodies hitting
  the xmldom fallback) from regular container logs without waiting for
  the SSR watchdog to kill a container.

  Cache hits are not timed. Default is **server-on, browser-off** — the
  string overload is called from comment/draft preview paths with
  unpublished user input, so emitting warnings in the browser would leak
  draft text into the user's console and any client telemetry pipeline,
  and would repeat on each keystroke. The log message never includes a
  content excerpt for the same reason.

  Threshold and per-environment behaviour are configurable via the new
  `setSlowRenderThresholdMs(ms)` export: call with `500` from a
  browser-only init to opt browser bundles in, or with `0` to disable
  everywhere.

### Patch Changes

## 2.4.35

### Patch Changes

- Fix ReDoS in render-helper that hung SSR for >30s (#782)

- [#782](https://github.com/ecency/vision-next/pull/782) [`5d39b3e`](https://github.com/ecency/vision-next/commit/5d39b3e4d40b8a9895ca87608a922694a4f0c377) Thanks [@feruzm](https://github.com/feruzm)! - Replace the regex inside `removeDuplicateAttributes` with a linear-time
  tokenizer. The previous pattern had catastrophic backtracking on inputs
  like `<div style=background-color:yellow;">` (unquoted attribute value
  followed by a stray quote), pinning the V8 regex engine for tens of
  seconds on real post bodies and tripping the SSR event-loop watchdog.

  Also drop a redundant `md.render(input)` call from the DOMParser
  fallback path in `markdown-to-html.method.ts` — the markdown output
  from the primary path is already available and re-rendering it cost
  ~100 ms per fallback hit on larger bodies.
