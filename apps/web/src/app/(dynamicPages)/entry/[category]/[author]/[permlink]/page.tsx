 * returns them empty, and the canonical logic needs them to point a reply at its
 * discussion root and to detect container/wave trees. That fetch lands in the
 * same request-scoped query cache the page dehydrates, so a SECOND full copy of
 * the entry (post body and voter array included) was being serialized to the
 * client purely as a side effect of building <head> tags. Nothing on this route
 * reads that query client-side; the page renders from the bridge copy.
 *
 * Dropping it at the dehydration boundary is deterministic, unlike removing the
 * query after use — generateMetadata and the page render share a request but
 * their order is not guaranteed.

// Deliberately NO loading.tsx on this route (nor on any ancestor segment).

// $RC script near the end of the document. On a busy phone the parser reached
// that script seconds after the bytes had arrived (measured: skeleton at
// 1.4 s, body at 5.7-7 s on slow 4G). Without the boundary the body is plain
// shell HTML that paints as it streams. A <Suspense> around the body would
// not help either: Fizz outlines any completed boundary over 500 bytes once
// the shell has passed progressiveChunkSize (12.8 KB, and the head + navbar
// alone are ~25 KB), so the body would again ship hidden plus a swap script.
// The Suspense around EntryRelatedFooter stays because it is BELOW the body.
// Pinned by specs/app/entry-page-no-ssr-skeleton.spec.ts.
//
// Trade-offs accepted with no boundary above the body:
//  - Fizz only contains render errors at Suspense boundaries, so a throw in
//    the SSR render of the post subtree is a full-page 500 instead of the
//    skeleton plus a client retry. EntryPageStaticBody guards the realistic
//    case (the markdown renderer) by falling back to the raw body.
//  - On a cold hard load (no CF/origin cached HTML, or any logged-in user)
//    nothing flushes until the entry and account fetches below resolve; the
//    skeleton used to flush the navbar at TTFB. If that ever shows up in the
//    SSR duration histogram, shorten the wait rather than re-adding a boundary.
//  - Soft navigations keep the previous page on screen until the RSC response
//    arrives; the bprogress bar mounted in client-providers is the feedback.
