/*
  Warms the two auth-free queries that paint an entry page's final pixels
  (post tips and pro-members badges), firing with root hydration (#1668).

  Without this, both fetch only when their components mount. Historically
  those sat under the route-level Suspense boundary that the entry route's
  loading.tsx created (since removed for LCP), which React hydrated lazily
  AFTER the DeferredRender feature cascade, pushing the requests to ~4.5s
  although hydration completed ~2.9s. Warming from the root client tree is
  cheaper than waiting for the component mount either way and dedupes
  cleanly: the later mounts hit the fresh cache entry (staleTime 60s tips /
  5min pro-members).

  Section names below must stay in lockstep with the entry-vs-section split
  in features/next-middleware/cache-policy.ts, which keeps the union in TWO
  places: NO_CACHE_PROFILE_SECTIONS (wallet/settings/permissions/referrals/
  insights) plus the inline section array in its 2-segment entry branch. A
  future section missing here costs exactly one throwaway 404 GET, nothing
  more.
