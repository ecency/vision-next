"use client"; // Error boundaries must be Client Components

/**
 * This is the app's ONLY error module. #1808 asked whether the entry, wave,
 * feed, profile and community routes should get an `error.tsx` of their own now
 * that their loading modules are gone. The answer is no. The reason is worth
 * recording so the next reader does not re-derive it.
 *
 * A route-level `error.tsx` would not catch what those routes now risk. Next
 * compiles it into a `'use client'` class boundary
 * (next/dist/client/components/error-boundary.js, getDerivedStateFromError),
 * and React's SERVER renderer does not run error boundaries at all: a throw
 * during SSR is recovered only AT a Suspense boundary, which client-renders
 * that segment instead. Measured on react-dom 19's own server renderer: with a
 * Suspense boundary around a throwing component the shell survives and the
 * boundary is emitted as `<!--$!-->` ("Switched to client rendering"); with a
 * class error boundary and NO Suspense, renderToPipeableStream calls
 * onShellError and the whole document is lost. Those routes deliberately have
 * no Suspense boundary above their content - that is what removed the hidden
 * segment and the late $RC swap, what moved /trending's LCP from 11.08s to
 * 8.70s - so an `error.tsx` there would be a client chunk on the hot path that
 * changes nothing about the failure it was added for.
 *
 * Nor would it catch the failures these routes actually see. Data fetches go
 * through withSsrTimeout (core/react-query/query-helpers.ts), which resolves
 * `undefined` rather than throwing. The pages already render an empty feed or
 * call notFound() for that.
 *
 * What is left for an error module to catch is a CLIENT render throw:
 * hydration, or a re-render after interaction. On these routes that is the same
 * deterministic throw that already took the SSR render down, so the reader
 * never reaches it - and where it is reachable, the fix is a guard at the call,
 * not a boundary around the page: a guard keeps the page and loses one line of
 * text, a boundary keeps the chrome and loses the page. See
 * core/entries/catch-post-image-safely.ts and
 * core/entries/post-body-summary-safely.ts for the two calls on that path.
 *
 * Revisit if a route grows a render that can fail on its own (a client-only
 * widget with real logic, a third-party embed), or if a Suspense boundary comes
 * back for an unrelated reason - with one in place, an `error.tsx` below it
 * would start earning its chunk.
