// mounting eagerly on every one of ~25 cards at hydration. Defer it: render
// just the label until the first interaction, then mount the real Popover (and
// open it immediately via the shared `show` state so the first hover isn't
// swallowed). Below-the-fold cards that are never hovered pay nothing.
