 * discover the LCP image until roughly three quarters of the document has
 * streamed, which is what CF RUM reports as 2.6s p75 resource-load-delay on
 * feed pages (56% of those samples are "poor" LCP, the worst of any real
 * element on the site). Rendering the link from a layout, outside the boundary,
 * puts it in the stream ~374KB earlier.
 *
 * Takes the whole eager window rather than just the topmost card: the first
 * entry may be NSFW or image-less, in which case it renders no thumbnail and
 * the LCP candidate is the next card up. Only the first entry that actually
 * yields a thumbnail is preloaded — preloading more than one would spend the
 * head start on an image that is not the LCP.
