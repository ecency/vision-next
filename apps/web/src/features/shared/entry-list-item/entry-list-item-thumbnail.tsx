  // It was BLUR that needed guarding: the host handed animated gifs back
  // untransformed at every size, so `?blur=1` returned the original file and the
  // LQIP layer became a second download of it (1.5 MB for a 150px slot,
  // #1802/#1803). ecency/imagehoster#47 renders the blur from the FIRST FRAME,
  // which is what this layer always wanted, so that guard is gone. Verified on
  // production against 16 real animated sources: every `?blur=1` came back as
  // 279-899 bytes of image/jpeg, at the source's own single-frame aspect (a
  // 1080x1350 x150 gif gives 20x25, a 720x540 x408 gives 20x15).
  //
  // It is SRCSET that needs guarding now, which is the reverse of what #1803
  // assumed when it kept srcset on the grounds that "for a static gif those
  // candidates are real". For an ANIMATED one they are not, at any width worth
  // picking. buildSrcSet emits width-ONLY URLs, and an animated render costs
  // frames x width x height, so a width with no height cap is unbounded in the
  // axis that matters: on a 1080x1350 x150 source, ?width=600 is 67 MP and
  // ?width=800 is 120 MP, both over the host's output budget, so both come back
  // as the untouched 1.5 MB original. `sizes` here is 100vw on mobile, so the
  // browser picks exactly those. Measured live on the two /trending cards that
  // have a gif cover:
  //
  //   srcset ?width=600/800/1024/1280  ->  1,572,008 B  image/gif  (passthrough)
  //   src    ?width=600&height=500     ->    196,832 B  image/webp
  //
  // The src box is capped on BOTH axes, so its output is bounded (30 MP here) and
  // the host renders it. Dropping srcset therefore makes the browser fetch the
  // one variant that is real. A static gif loses its responsive variants and
  // fetches the 600x500 src into a 150px desktop slot, which is a few KB more on
  // a rare card; an animated one stops pulling the full file, which is 1.4 MB.
