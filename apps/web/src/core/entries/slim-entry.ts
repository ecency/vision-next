  // Fast mode matters here because this runs on the server for every row of
  // every feed. The full lookup ends in markdown2Html plus a DOM parse, and on
  // a long body with no image at all that is hundreds of milliseconds of
  // synchronous CPU per row: one feed of such rows held a server's event loop
  // for five seconds, stalling every other request on that process. The one
  // class fast mode gives up is an ambiguous markdown image URL (one containing
  // a parenthesis), which the card then shows without a thumbnail.
