 * The plain-text summary a feed card shows under the title.
 *
 * An author-set `json_metadata.description` wins over the generated body
 * summary, but json_metadata is untrusted on-chain data: some publishing clients
 * write the whole markdown body into `description`, others a non-string. The card
 * used to render that value verbatim, so one such post became a wall of raw
 * markdown of unbounded height in the list. Both sources now go through the same
 * summary function, so the card always gets plain text capped at `length`. A
 * description that strips to nothing (an image-only one) falls back to the body.
 *
 * A slim feed row (`entry.slim`, body blanked by core/entries/slim-entry.ts)
 * already carries the finished card text in `description`, derived through this
 * very function. It is returned as is: parsing plain text as markdown a second
 * time eats characters the first pass kept literal (`\*` becomes `*` becomes
 * emphasis, `&lt;div&gt;` becomes a tag to strip), and the row's blank body
 * would make the fallback depend on whether render-helper's cache still holds
 * the full entry's summary, a hydration mismatch waiting to happen.
