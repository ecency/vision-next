/**
 * A key whose English value carries a `{{placeholder}}` must be called with the
 * values that fill it. `i18next.t("profile-info.joined")` with no second
 * argument does not throw and does not fall back: it renders the placeholder
 * verbatim, so the UI showed a literal "Joined: {{n}}".
 *
 * `profile-info.joined` had two consumers pulling it in opposite directions:
 * the account info tooltip wants the sentence "Joined: 3 years ago", the
 * username hover card wants a bare cell title with the date printed
 * underneath. The source string flipped between the two forms three times
 * (385596ab67 sentence, fc8a0550e3 label, b83f037f06 back to sentence), and
 * each flip fixed one consumer by breaking the other.
 *
 * Every non-English locale holds the LABEL form, because that is what the
 * string was when Crowdin last translated it, and a source edit does not
 * invalidate an existing translation. So the split keeps `joined` as the label
 * the 18 translations already match, and gives the sentence its own `joined-n`
 * key. Anything else would have made the hover card fall back to English in
 * every locale.
 *
 * No unit test would have caught the original bug: specs/setup-any-spec.ts
 * mocks i18next so `t()` returns the key verbatim, which means a render
 * assertion sees "profile-info.joined" and never the interpolated value. The
 * check has to run against the source and the real locale table instead.
