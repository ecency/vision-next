/**
 * The call sites that run `postBodySummary` on a body the app did not slim.
 *
 * The twin of catch-post-image-guarded-call-sites, for the other
 * author-controlled string a card renders. Feed rows normally arrive with
 * `body: ""` (slimEntry), which starves the markdown renderer, but four paths
 * carry a FULL body here:
 *   - slimEntrySafely returns the un-slimmed entry when slimming throws
 *     (core/entries/slim-entry.ts),
 *   - BODY_BACKED_SECTIONS skips slimming for the comments/replies profile
 *     feeds (api/queries/get-account-posts-feed-query.ts, reachable as
 *     /feed/comments/@user and /feed/replies/@user),
 *   - the profile's pinned entry is fetched through the post cache, unslimmed,
 *   - search rows are never slimmed at all.
 * The slimmer itself is a fifth: it calls entrySummary on the full body of
 * every row of every ranked feed to derive `description`, inside the queryFn.
 *
 * A throw at the card reader is a blank route, not a missing excerpt: it runs
 * during the SSR render of the feed, profile and community routes, which have
 * no Suspense boundary above their cards any more (#1786 and siblings) and no
 * route error.tsx (see app/global-error.tsx for why neither is coming back).
