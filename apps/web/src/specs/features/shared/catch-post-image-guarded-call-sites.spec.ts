/**
 * Where `catchPostImage` may be called raw, and where it may not.
 *
 * The extractor's last tier is `markdown2Html` + a DOM parse over an
 * author-written body. That tier is reachable from every call site that is
 * handed a real body and finds no image in `json_metadata` or by regex, and it
 * has thrown on author input before (a numeric character reference above
 * U+10FFFF raised a RangeError out of `sanitizeHtml`; fixed at source in
 * @ecency/render-helper, and the app builds the package from source, so this
 * is about the NEXT one).
 *
 * What a throw costs is not "one missing image". apps/web has a single
 * `app/global-error.tsx` and no per-segment `error.tsx`, so there is no
 * boundary that turns a throw into a degraded row: on the server it fails the
 * response, in the browser it replaces the whole app with the error screen.
 *
 * Feed rows normally arrive with `body: ""` (slimEntry), which starves the
 * markdown tier, but a full body still reaches these calls three ways:
 *   - slimEntrySafely / cardOnlyEntryPage hand back the UN-slimmed entry when
 *     slimming throws (core/entries/slim-entry.ts),
 *   - BODY_BACKED_SECTIONS skips slimming for the comments/replies profile
 *     feeds (api/queries/get-account-posts-feed-query.ts),
 *   - the profile's pinned entry is fetched through the post cache, unslimmed.
 * Search rows, drafts, schedules, RSS items and the proposal body are never
 * slimmed at all — those carry a full body by design.
 *
 * So: every apps/web call site that is handed an author-written body goes
 * through `catchPostImageSafely`. The exceptions below are listed by name with
 * their reason, so the decision is pinned rather than implicit, and the sweep
 * at the bottom stops a new file from quietly joining them.
