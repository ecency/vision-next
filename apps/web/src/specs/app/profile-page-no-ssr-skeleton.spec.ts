// The profile index ships its feed cards inside the SSR shell. page.tsx awaits
// the account, the first feed page and the pinned entry before it returns any
// JSX, so a Suspense boundary above it is emitted PENDING: the skeleton goes in
// the shell and the cards land in a hidden <div id="S:n"> chunk that a $RC swap
// script reveals only once the parser reaches it. On a throttled phone that
// swap runs well after the HTML has arrived (#1783, #1778).
//
// This route is the one in the series where the win is NOT LCP. Its LCP element
// is the profile header, which the layout renders outside the boundary, and the
// baseline already reflects that (LCP 2.07s, start render 2.00s). What moves is
// the feed: 2 hidden segments and a $RC swap on that baseline.
//
// And it can cut the other way. With no boundary above the page, nothing
// flushes until the page's awaits resolve — the account fetch, the feed fetch
// and, for accounts with a pinned post, a second hop that depends on the first
// — so the header itself now waits on work it used to paint ahead of. Whether
// the cards arriving early beats the header arriving later is a measurement,
// not an argument: it is checked on alpha after this lands, against test
// 260909_7C_P, and reverted if start render or LCP regresses.
//
// A loading module is such a boundary for its OWN segment AND for every segment
// nested under it, which is why profile/[username]/loading.tsx had to go rather
// than move: it covered the profile index and, with it, every profile tab.
// Each tab that relied on it got its own leaf module instead (below), so no tab
// lost its pending UI — except wallet/, which is deliberately left with none.
