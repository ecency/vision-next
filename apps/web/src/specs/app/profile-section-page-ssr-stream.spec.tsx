// through React's server renderer and asserts on the HTML a browser would
// receive: the cards must be part of the shell, never inside a hidden segment
// that a later swap script reveals (#1805).
//
// progressiveChunkSize is forced tiny so React outlines any completed Suspense
// boundary the way it does in production, where the head, navbar and profile
// card alone exceed the 12.8 KB default: a <Suspense> re-introduced anywhere
// above the list shows up here as `<div hidden id="S:n">` around the cards and
// fails the test. A route-level loading.tsx cannot be exercised through a
// component render; the structure spec next to this one pins its absence, on
// the route AND on every ancestor segment.
//
// Two of the page's three branches are streamed. The default branch renders
// ProfileEntriesList (server page 1 + infinite list); `?before=` renders
// ProfileEntriesArchive (a fully server-rendered list plus the crawlable
// pager). The third, `?q=`, is NOT streamed here: page.tsx reaches
// `getSearchApiInfiniteQueryOptions` straight off @ecency/sdk, which the global
// spec setup does not stand in for, and replacing that mock file-locally would
// take the card render's own SDK stand-ins down with it. Its chain
// (ProfileSearchContent -> SearchListItem) is pinned structurally instead, in
// profile-section-page-no-ssr-skeleton.spec.ts.
