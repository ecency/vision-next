/**
 * A server component may not reach a "use client" module through the
 * `@/features/shared` barrel.
 *
 * The barrel re-exports its modules with `export *`. When one of those modules
 * is a client boundary, that star re-export hands server components `undefined`
 * instead of the component: React reports "Element type is invalid ... but got:
 * undefined" while server-rendering, and "Received a promise that resolves to:
 * undefined" in the browser. The subtree renders as nothing at all, at HTTP 200,
 * so it fails silently. That is how every profile page shipped with no posts
 * when `entry-list-content` gained its "use client" directive.
 *
 * Nothing else in the suite can see this: vitest renders components in jsdom and
 * never crosses the server/client boundary, so the barrel resolves normally
 * there, and `next build` compiles it happily. It only breaks when a real server
 * renders the route. So the check is on the import graph rather than on output.
 *
 * Deliberately conservative: a module imported ANYWHERE by a client component is
 * treated as client-side and skipped, because it cannot be told apart from a
 * genuine server component by source alone. That trades some coverage for never
 * failing a PR that is actually fine.
