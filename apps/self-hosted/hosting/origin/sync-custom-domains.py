"""
Custom-domain (and dotted-subdomain) TLS + vhost sync for managed blog hosting.

Two kinds of host need a per-host certificate:

  * verified custom domains of active pro tenants;
  * tenants whose Hive account name contains a dot (e.g. louis.random). Their blog
    lives at louis.random.blogs.ecency.com, which is TWO labels under the base
    domain, so the *.blogs.ecency.com wildcard certificate does not cover it
    (TLS wildcards match exactly one label). Without this, the tenant's blog fails
    with SSL_ERROR / "no alternative certificate subject name matches".

For each such host this script:
  1. before a FIRST issuance only, checks the domain resolves to this origin (protects LE
     rate limits). A failed lookup never removes anything: removal is driven solely by the
     domain leaving the DB, so a resolver blip cannot delete a live vhost/certificate,
  2. issues a Let's Encrypt certificate via HTTP-01 webroot if none exists
     (the default_server on :80 serves /var/www/html, which answers the challenge),
  3. generates an nginx vhost that terminates TLS and proxies to the blog container
     with X-Tenant-Id set to the tenant, so the container serves the right config,
  4. removes vhosts (and stops renewing certs) for domains no longer in the DB,
  5. reloads nginx when anything changed.

Run from cron every 5 minutes. Use --dry-run to log intended actions only.
State (issuance attempt backoff) lives in state.json next to this script.
